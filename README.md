You can run the file normally by double clicking it.
The file may show as a Virus, but I give you my personal assurance that it is not. Of course, if you do not believe me, so be it, but just know that it may show as this because I edited XP_EOS.exe, altering its checksum, meaning that it shows as a virus, even when it's not.
